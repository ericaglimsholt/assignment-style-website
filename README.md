# Assignment - style your own website
This is an assignment for the course "digital techniques and production". You are given a easy template of a webpage. Your assignment is to change the CSS to make it as beautiful as you want! Now, CSS isn't always easy even if it feels like it. You are more than welcome to ask each others and Google things you want to do. Add `CSS` to every search you do to make it easy. Copy and paste. That's how we roll. Really.

## Setting up the project
1. Download this repository as a zip-file to your computer.
2. Save the folder somewhere where you easily can find it again. For example `/documents/sites`.
3. If you double click the `index.html` file you will open the page in your default browser. You can now see how the page looks like.
4. Download the tool [Atom](https://atom.io/) and install it as an application on your computer.
5. Open the application Atom. 
6. In Atom, go under "file" > "add project folder" and select your folder that you have downloaded from Github.
7. To check if all works: click on `index.html` in Atom to open the file in Atom.
8. Change "Your title" in the `<h1>` element to something else (it can be whatever you want).
9. Save the file.
