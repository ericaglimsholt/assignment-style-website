# Assignment - style your own website
This is an assignment for the course "digital techniques and production". You are given a easy template of a webpage. Your assignment is to change the CSS to make it as beautiful as you want! Now, CSS isn't always easy even if it feels like it. You are more than welcome to ask each others and Google things you want to do. Add `CSS` to every search you do to make it easy for example "css change background color". Copy and paste. That's how we roll. Really.

## Setting up the project
1. Download this repository as a zip-file to your computer.
2. Save the folder somewhere where you easily can find it again. For example `/documents/sites`.
3. If you double click the `index.html` file you will open the page in your default browser. You can now see how the page looks like.
4. Download the tool [Atom](https://atom.io/) and install it as an application on your computer.
5. Open the application Atom. 
6. In Atom, go under "file" > "add project folder" and select your folder that you have downloaded from Github.
7. To check if all works: click on `index.html` in Atom to open the file in Atom.
8. Change "Your title" in the `<h1>` element to something else (it can be whatever you want).
9. Save the file.
10. In your browser - update the page. You should now see your change.

## Requirements
So now it's time for you to start programming! You decide yourself on how much you want to change. We don't have this assignment to make you programmers - it's for you to understand what programming is. But we need to have some requirements. Here they are.

* Change the text inside `<h1></h1>` to a fitting title for your page.
* Change the background color on your page.
* Change the font on your page.
* Insert at least one image of your own choosing.

## Help
You can do everything (more or less) in CSS and HTML. I've created some list for you to look at if you find it hard to know where to begin.
